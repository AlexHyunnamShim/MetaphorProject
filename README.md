Implementation of my initial idea suggested in the first round of screening:


Created a chatbot feature that glues the "Search" and "Get contents" metaphor APIs. Users can type in what web pages they want to search for such as "how to swing a golf club", then receive a summarized version of its html content to make searches more convenient and streamlined.

Sorry about not having the project deployed, I couldn't get the OpenAI key to work

You can run the app locally by following the 2 steps:

Start backend by:
cd api
flask run

Start frontend by:
cd ui
npm start
